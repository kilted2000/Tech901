            <p>My superpower is my curious mind. I am always interested in the hows and whys of things. I want to see behind the scenes to see how everything works</p>
            <p>While admittedly one reason why I would like to take Tech901's Web Programming course is to hopefully find employment in the field, I am also excited about the idea of building websites and apps that people can use in their daily lives.</p>
